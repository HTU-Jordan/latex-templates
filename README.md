# LaTeX Templates
Generic LaTeX templates for everyone to use.

## Important
Make sure the LaTeX engine is set to __XeLaTeX__ as this is required for the fonts to work.

## Templates
There are 3 folders containing 3 different templates.

You can use these templates in two ways:
1. Clone on Overleaf (Easy - Stored privately on the cloud)
2. Setup a LaTeX distribution on your own device (Difficult - Requires Linux and massive hard disk space)
